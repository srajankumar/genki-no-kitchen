## 元気の - Genki no kitchen

Save money and reduce waste in by using up what you already have on hand.

## About

Many households waste food due to poor planning and lack of awareness. Create a mobile app that uses computer vision to recognize food items in a user's refrigerator and suggests recipes based on available ingredients. It could also track expiration dates and send alerts to prevent food spoilage.

Consumers often misunderstand "use by" and "best before" labels. Design an app that educates users on proper food storage techniques and utilizes AI to suggest creative ways to use expiring ingredients, reducing household food waste.

## Solution

- Detection of edibles giving us name, shelf life, recipes of the dishes that can be cooked with manual addition of the edibles with the price, quantity of the same
  Recipe generation of the manually added edibles.
- Detection of manufacture and expiry date along with other food information using barcode scanner and OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
